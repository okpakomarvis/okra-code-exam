# Okra Code Challenge

The purpose of this test is to build the Wallet Application found here using the above boilerplate:
https://xd.adobe.com/view/2190ec88-7caf-4e23-68d1-e9b6b8ec2bf3-57a1/

You can build this out in as many pages as you like (We recommend no more than 2-3 as we are more worried about quality versus quantity) 

The purpose will be to nderstand your knowledge of:
1. MVC Structure
2. Client to Server commnuication (we recommend Redux)
3. Code reusability and struture 
4. Best Practicies in nominculture, strucutre, etc.
5. UI / UX (but this isn't a design competition) 
6. How you handle dummy / static data [feel free to send back the same random data in the XD or ***cough*** faker module ***cough***]
7. Converting UI to Usable Code

This doesnt have to be connected to any LIVE data source, but feel free to impress us :)

If you move on to the next step in the coding challenge you will build upon your creation here!

Once done send the results to challenge@okra.ng
